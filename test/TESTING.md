## Testing

Unit test are critical to the OpenZeppelin framework. They help ensure code quality and mitigate against security vulnerabilities. The directory structure within the `/test` directory corresponds to the `/contracts` directory. OpenZeppelin uses Truffle testing framework(based on the Mocha JavaScript testing framework) and the Chai assertion library. To learn more about how tests are structured, please reference OpenZeppelinâ€™s Testing Guide.
